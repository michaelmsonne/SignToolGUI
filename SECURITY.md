## Security

I takes the security of my software products and services seriously, which includes all source code repositories managed through my GitHub.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any of my repositories, please report it to me as described below.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them to me at [https://temp.temp](https://temp.temp).

If you prefer to submit without logging in, send email to [secure@domain.com](mailto:secure@domain.com). If possible, encrypt your message with our PGP key; please download it from the [PGP Key](https://temp.temp/pgp).

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

  * Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Preferred Languages

I prefer all communications to be in English/Danish if needed.
